## About

This repository contains the source code of the Digital Green Certificates Verifier Service.

The DGC Verifier Service is part of the national backends and caches the public keys that are distributed through the [DGCG](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgc-gateway). It is accessed by the DGC Verifier Apps ([Android](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgca-verifier-app-android), [iOS](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgca-verifier-app-ios)) to update the key store periodically.

## Development

**Note:** The verifier service needs a connection to the gateway in order to run. There is no standalone version available.

### Prerequisites

- [Open JDK 11](https://openjdk.java.net)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
- An installation of the [DGCG](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgc-gateway)
- Keys to access the [DGCG](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgc-gateway) via the
  [DGCG Connector](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgc-lib) of the [DGC-lib](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgc-lib)
- Authenticate to [Github Packages](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-apache-maven-registry)

#### Needed keys for accessing the DGC Gateway 
<p id="access-keys"></p>
For accessing the DGC Gateway via the DGC Connector you need the following keys in place:

- The public key of the used Gateway. The public key should be stored in the *tls_trust_store*. If you use one of the 
  provided gateways, you will get the public key as .pem from DIGIT. This .pem needs to be converted into pkcs12 format:
  ````
  openssl pkcs12 -export -in pub_tls.pem -name trust -out tls_trust_store.p12
  ````
- Your key pair for accessing the Gateway stored in *tls_key_store*. This needs to be generated by yourself and then whitelisted by operations team (see [onboarding manual](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgc-participating-countries/blob/main/gateway/OnboardingChecklist.md) of the Gateway). To use it in the verifier service this needs to be converted as well into pkcs12 format:
  ````
  openssl pkcs12 -export -in tls.pem -inkey tls_private.pem -name 1 -out tls_key_store.p12
  ````

- The public key of the TrustAnchor of the Gateway. If you use one of the provided Gateways you will get it as well, at onboarding. The key should be stored in a jks file.

For more information on how to generate certificates for DGC Gateway and how to run your own local one, please have a look in the documentation of the [Gateway](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgc-gateway).

#### Authenticating in to GitHub Packages

As some of the required libraries (and/or versions are pinned/available only from GitHub Packages) You need to authenticate
to [GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-apache-maven-registry)
The following steps need to be followed

- Create [PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) with scopes:
  - `read:packages` for downloading packages

##### GitHub Maven

- Copy/Augment `~/.m2/settings.xml` with the contents of `settings.xml` present in this repository
  - Replace `${app.packages.username}` with your github username
  - Replace `${app.packages.password}` with the generated PAT

##### GitHub Docker Registry

- Run `docker login docker.pkg.github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates` before running further docker commands.
  - Use your GitHub username as username
  - Use the generated PAT as password
  


For further information about the keys and certificates needed, please refer to the documentation of the 
[DGCG](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgc-gateway) and the 
[DGC-lib](https://github.com/eu-digital-green-certificates/dgc-lib)
  
### Build

Whether you cloned or downloaded the 'zipped' sources you will either find the sources in the chosen checkout-directory or get a zip file with the source code, which you can expand to a folder of your choice.

In either case open a terminal pointing to the directory you put the sources in. The local build process is described afterwards depending on the way you choose.


#### Build with maven
Building this project is done with maven.  

* Check [settings.xml](settings.xml) in the root folder of this git repository as example.  
  Copy the servers to your own `~/.m2/settings.xml` in order to connect the GitHub repositories we use in our code. Provide your GitHub username and access token (see [GitHub Help](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)) under the variables suggested.

* Run the following command from the project root folder
```shell
mvn clean install
```
All required dependencies will be downloaded, the project build and the artifact stored in your local repository.
#### Run with docker
* Perform maven build as described above
* Place the keys and certificates named [above](#access-keys) into the ***certs*** folder.
* Adjust the values in the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file to fit the url for the gateway you use and 
  your keys and certificates you have to access it.
  ```yaml
  - DGC_GATEWAY_CONNECTOR_ENDPOINT=https://dgc-gateway.example.com
  - DGC_GATEWAY_CONNECTOR_TLSTRUSTSTORE_PATH=file:/ec/prod/app/san/dgc/tls_trust_store.p12
  - DGC_GATEWAY_CONNECTOR_TLSTRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD=dgcg-p4ssw0rd
  - DGC_GATEWAY_CONNECTOR_TLSKEYSTORE_ALIAS=1
  - DGC_GATEWAY_CONNECTOR_TLSKEYSTORE_PATH=file:/ec/prod/app/san/dgc/tls_key_store.p12
  - DGC_GATEWAY_CONNECTOR_TLSKEYSTORE_PASSWORD=dgcg-p4ssw0rd
  - DGC_GATEWAY_CONNECTOR_TRUSTANCHOR_ALIAS=ta
  - DGC_GATEWAY_CONNECTOR_TRUSTANCHOR_PATH=file:/ec/prod/app/san/dgc/trust_anchor.jks
  - DGC_GATEWAY_CONNECTOR_TRUSTANCHOR_PASSWORD=dgcg-p4ssw0rd
  ```
***Note:*** Leave the path as is and only change the file names, as the ***certs*** folder will be mapped to this folder inside the docker container.

* Run the following command from the project root folder

```shell
docker-compose up --build
```

After all containers have started, you will be able to reach the service on your [local machine](http://localhost:8080/api/docs) under port 8080.
